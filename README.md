# Time Series Forecasting of Indian Equity Market using Machine Learning

A complete ML pipeline to forecast Indian stock prices using ARIMA, Prophet, and LSTM. This project showcases real-time forecasting, dashboard visualization, and multi-model comparisons for 9 major Indian stocks.

---

## üöÄ Project Overview

This project aims to predict future stock prices for selected Indian companies using:
1. Statistical Modeling (ARIMA)
2. Additive Models (Facebook Prophet)
3. Deep Learning (LSTM)

It covers data collection, preprocessing, modeling, evaluation, and dashboard visualization ‚Äî an end-to-end pipeline from raw data to insights.

## Models Built

| Model   | Description                                      |
|---------|--------------------------------------------------|
| ARIMA   | Classical time series model                      |
| Prophet | Trend-seasonality based forecasting              |
| LSTM    | Deep learning model for sequence prediction      |

Each model is evaluated using:
- RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)
- MAE (Mean Absolute Error)

---

## üìà Output

- Future predictions for each of the 9 selected stocks
- Visualized using Dash web app
- CSV files saved in `/lstm_results/` as:
  - `STOCK_forecast.csv` (train/test/prediction)
  - `STOCK_future_forecast.csv` (next N days prediction)

---

## Dash App Usage

To run the dashboard locally:

```bash
python app.py
‚ö†Ô∏èMake sure your lstm_results/ folder is in the same directory as app.py.

How to Use:
Clone this repo

Run the notebook (Time_Series_Forecasting.ipynb) in Google Colab

Forecasts will be saved in lstm_results/

Launch app.py to explore the results visually

üî≠ Future Enhancements:
Add evaluation for future_forecast using post-hoc data

Deploy dashboard using Streamlit Cloud or Render

Integrate financial news and sentiment analysis
